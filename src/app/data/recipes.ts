    descriptionShort:

    cookingInstructions: `
        Cook the Beans:

        If using dried beans, soak 250g (1 ½ cups) red kidney beans overnight in water.
        Drain, rinse, and boil in fresh water for 1.5–2 hours until soft.
        Drain and mash into a coarse paste (not too smooth).
        (If using canned beans, simply drain and mash them.)
        Sauté the Onion & Garlic:

        Heat 2 tbsp oil or butter in a pan over medium heat.
        Add 1 chopped onion and sauté until golden brown.
        Stir in 2 minced garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute.
        Season the Filling:

        Add the mashed beans to the pan.
        Season with 1 tsp salt, ½ tsp black pepper, and ½ tsp ground coriander (optional).
        Stir well and cook for 3-5 minutes until flavors combine.
        (Optional: Add 50-100g chopped smoked ham or bacon for Rachuli Lobiani.)
        Let the filling cool completely before assembling.
        Step 2: Prepare the Dough
        Activate the Yeast:

        In a bowl, mix 7g (2 tsp) dry yeast with 250ml (1 cup) warm water and 1 tsp sugar.
        Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.
        Make the Dough:

        In a large bowl, combine 500g (4 cups) flour and 1 tsp salt.
        Add the yeast mixture and 2 tbsp oil or melted butter.
        Knead for 7-10 minutes until soft and elastic.
        Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise for 1-1.5 hours, until doubled in size.
        Step 3: Assemble the Lobiani
        Divide and Roll the Dough:

        Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 2-4 equal pieces (depending on size preference).
        Roll each piece into a flat circle (about 1 cm thick and 20-25 cm wide).
        Fill the Dough:

        Place a generous amount of bean filling in the center of the dough.
        Gather the edges and seal tightly, forming a pouch.
        Flip it over and gently flatten into a round disc (about 1.5 cm thick).
        Step 4: Cook the Lobiani
        Option 1: Bake (Traditional Method)
        8. Preheat the Oven to 200°C (400°F).
        9. Transfer the shaped Lobiani to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
        10. Brush with melted butter for a golden crust (optional).
        11. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.

    descriptionShort: `Khachapuri is a traditional Georgian cheese-filled bread, often considered the country's national dish. It comes in various regional styles, with the most famous being Adjarian Khachapuri, shaped like a boat and topped with a runny egg and butter. The dough is soft and fluffy, while the filling typically consists of sulguni or imeretian cheese. Khachapuri is rich, savory, and best enjoyed fresh out of the oven`,

    ingredientQuantities: ['500g', '100g', '50p', '2p', '20g', '500g'],
    cookingInstructions: ` 
    Step 1: Prepare the Dough
In a bowl, mix 7g (2 tsp) dry yeast with 1 tsp sugar and 250ml (1 cup) warm milk or water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy. In a large mixing bowl, combine 500g (4 cups) all-purpose flour and 1 tsp salt. Add the yeast mixture and 2 tbsp vegetable oil or melted butter. Knead the dough for 7-10 minutes until soft and elastic. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise for 1-1.5 hours, until doubled in size.

Step 2: Prepare the Cheese Filling
In a bowl, mix 300g (2 cups) grated sulguni or feta cheese with 200g (1 ½ cups) mozzarella or imeretian cheese. If desired, add 1 egg for a creamier texture.

Step 3: Shape the Khachapuri
Punch down the dough and divide it into 2-4 equal pieces, depending on the size. Roll each piece into an oval or round shape, about 1 cm thick. For Adjarian Khachapuri, shape the dough into a boat, leaving space in the center for the filling.

Step 4: Fill and Bake
Preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F). Place the shaped dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Fill the center with the cheese mixture. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown.

Step 5: Add the Egg (Optional, for Adjarian Khachapuri)
Remove from the oven, make a small well in the center, and crack an egg on top. Return to the oven for 2-3 minutes, just until the egg is slightly set but still runny.`,

    descriptionShort: `Khinkali are traditional Georgian dumplings filled with spiced meat (usually beef, pork, or lamb) and a flavorful broth inside. They are shaped with a twisted top, which acts as a handle for eating. The most common variations include Kalakuri Khinkali (with herbs) and Mtiuluri Khinkali (without herbs).`,

    ingredientQuantities: ['500g', '100g', '2p', '20g', '500g', '500g', '1p'],
    cookingInstructions: ` 
    Step 1: Prepare the Dough
In a large bowl, mix 500g flour and 1 tsp salt. Gradually add 250ml warm water, mixing with a spoon or hands. Knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover with a cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.

Step 2: Make the Filling
In a bowl, mix ground meat, onion, garlic, salt, black pepper, cumin, and red pepper flakes. Gradually add cold water or broth, stirring until the mixture becomes juicy and slightly soupy. If using, mix in chopped cilantro or parsley.

Step 3: Shape the Khinkali
Roll out the dough to 2mm thickness and cut out 10-12 cm (4-5 inch) circles. Place 1-2 tbsp of filling in the center. Gather the edges and pleat them tightly to form a twisted top (aim for at least 15 folds). Pinch to seal.

Step 4: Boil the Khinkali
Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Drop in the khinkali one by one, stirring carefully to prevent sticking. Boil for 7-10 minutes, until they float and the dough is cooked through.

Step 5: Serve
Drain and serve hot, sprinkled with black pepper. Hold the twisted top, take a bite, sip the juicy broth, and enjoy! (Don't eat the top—it’s just a handle!)`,
